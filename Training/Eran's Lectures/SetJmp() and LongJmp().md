In C++, `setjmp` and `longjmp` are functions provided by the C standard library. 
Although they can be used in C++, they are not specific to the C++ language.

`setjmp` and `longjmp` are used for non-local control flow in C programs. 
They allow you to perform a non-local jump from one point in your program to another point that is not directly within the call stack. 
This means you can jump out of deeply nested functions or bypass normal function return mechanisms.

Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `setjmp`: The `setjmp` function is used to save the current execution state, including register values and the program counter, so that it can be restored later. It takes a single argument, a `jmp_buf` object, which is a data structure used to store the execution state. `setjmp` returns an integer value: 0 if called directly, and a nonzero value if returning through `longjmp`.
    
2. `longjmp`: The `longjmp` function is used to perform the non-local jump. It takes a `jmp_buf` object and a jump target value as arguments. The `jmp_buf` object should have been previously set up using `setjmp`. When `longjmp` is called, the execution state is restored to the state saved by `setjmp`, and program control is transferred to the jump target value provided.
    

Here's a simple example to demonstrate the usage of `setjmp` and `longjmp`:

```c++
#include <iostream> 
#include <csetjmp>

std::jmp_buf jump_buffer;

void foo() {     
	std::cout << "Inside foo()" << std::endl;    
	std::longjmp(jump_buffer, 1); 
	// Jump to the point of setjmp    
	std::cout << "This line will not be executed." << std::endl; 
} 

int main() {     
	if (std::setjmp(jump_buffer) == 0) {         
		std::cout << "Initial setjmp()" << std::endl;         
		foo();     
	}     
	else {         
		std::cout << "Returning from longjmp" << std::endl;     
	}      
	return 0; 
}
```

In this example, the `setjmp` function is called inside the `main` function, and if it returns 0, indicating the direct call to `setjmp`, it proceeds to call the `foo` function. Inside `foo`, we call `longjmp` to jump back to the point of the previous `setjmp` call. 

Please note that the usage of `setjmp` and `longjmp` should be handled with caution, as they can easily lead to hard-to-maintain and error-prone code due to their non-local nature and potential for unpredictable program flow. It is generally recommended to use structured control flow mechanisms like exceptions instead of `setjmp` and `longjmp` in C++ programs.
