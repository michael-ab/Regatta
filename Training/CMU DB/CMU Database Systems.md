## 05 - Buffer Pool - Memory Management

> [!NOTE] Title
> Memory part (not disk!)

![[Pasted image 20230519165553.png]]
Dirty flag: a bit to know if the page was modified 
Pin/Reference Counter: number of threads/queries currectly running that want this page in memory

Locks vs Latches
![[Pasted image 20230519170316.png]]

Page directory: (in disk) map page ID to page location in the database files
Page table: (in memory) map page ID to copy of the page in buffer pool frames
![[Pasted image 20230519170516.png]]

Allocation Policies

![[Pasted image 20230519182449.png]]

Multiple buffer pool
Approach: Object ID vs Hasing 
![[Pasted image 20230519182810.png]]

Scan sharing:
1. Queries can reuse data retrieved  from storage or operator computations.
2. Allow multiple queries to attach to a single cursor that scan a table.

Correlated Attributes
![[Pasted image 20230602155700.png]]

Cost Estimations
In real life data isn't uniform so we need to store for each column the number of tuple in each row.
This is also too much so be divided the rows in buckets.
