## 05 - Buffer Pool - Memory Management

> [!NOTE] Title
> Memory part (not disk!)

![[Pasted image 20230519165553.png]]
Dirty flag: a bit to know if the page was modified 
Pin/Reference Counter: number of threads/queries currectly running that want this page in memory

Locks vs Latches

Page directory: (in disk) map page ID to page location in the database files
Page table: (in memory) map page ID to copy of the page in buffer pool frames

Multiple buffer pool

Multiple buffer pool
Approach: Object ID vs Hasing 
![[Pasted image 20230519182810.png]]

Scan sharing:
1. Queries can reuse data retrieved  from storage or operator computations.
2. Allow multiple queries to attach to a single cursor that scan a table.
