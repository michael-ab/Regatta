### Conflict Serializable

Conflict Serializable iff no circle in the dependencies graph
Example:
![[Conflict Serializable]]

Conflicts:
1. R/W
2. W/R
3. W/W

### 2PL 
Nobody use the 2PL as is but strict 2PL or SS2LP

![[Strict 2PL]]

### Recoverability

Not recoverable transaction example:
![[Not recoverable txn example]]

### ACA
(Avoids cascading aborts)

â€¢ Avoids cascading aborts (ACA)
If T_i reads x from T_j , then commit_j< read_i(x)

See [[DMS-HS20-Transactions_CCR.pdf]]

### MVCC

- Snapshot creation
- Snapshot read
- Isolated writes
- Read-after-Writes
- Commitment

![[MVCC]]

Snapshot delete/ Reclamation -> Need to be efficient and "just on time"


### OR2MW (Other Reads to My Writes)
Regatta Algo
Waitable (can wait) if the is some colisions
When a txn TX* finish, we compare the write vector W(x1, x2, ..., xn) with the read vector Ri(x1, x2, ..., xn) of all active txns.
For i in all ID of all active txns
	if W(x1, x2, ..., xn) intersection Ri(x1, x2, ..., xn) -> Not empty
		Abort TX*

### MR2OW
See TP Consistency #14 - Manipulation to understand why:
No need for MR2OW
No need for snapshots

###### Michael Adda explication
Soft Lock: Block writers in the validation state
Hard Lock: Block everyone (writers and readers) in the validation state to commit

### Commit in Distributed Clustered

### Post Commit
![[Post Commit]]

### First Committer Wins

If there is 2 transactions that want to write the same row in the same time, the first to write will write and the second transaction will failed.

working phase | validation (validation for commit) | Commit | Post Commit

### Break Hard Lock

If one of the nodes can't be hard locked, we released the hard locks from the other nodes for this transaction.
If break hard lock happens x times, the transaction is aborted.
