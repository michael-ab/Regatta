> [!NOTE] 
> In most database systems, the creation of indexes is not automatic based on inserted queries. Instead, the user typically needs to explicitly create indexes using the `CREATE INDEX` statement. This allows the user to define which columns to index and the type of index to use (e.g., B-tree, hash, etc.).

In a database, index lookup and full scan are two methods used to retrieve data from tables. 
Understanding the difference between them is crucial for optimizing query performance.

## Index Lookup
An index is a data structure that allows for quick and efficient data retrieval based on the values in one or more columns. 
Index lookup involves using the index to locate specific rows instead of scanning the entire table.

- Query optimizer examines the query and determines if an index can be utilized.
- Index lookup involves navigating through the index's data structure to locate rows that satisfy the query conditions.
- Database engine retrieves the rows from the table using pointers stored in the index.

Index lookups are faster when querying a small subset of rows selectively. 
They are useful for improving performance when the indexed columns align well with the query conditions.

## Full Scan
A full scan, also known as a table scan, involves examining every row in a table to find the desired data.
It reads all the rows sequentially without utilizing indexes.

- Database engine reads each row from the beginning of the table until the end, regardless of query conditions.
- Query conditions are evaluated for each row, and only rows that satisfy the conditions are included in the result set.

Full scans are slower compared to index lookups, especially for large tables. 
They are beneficial when querying a significant portion or the entire table or when query conditions don't align well with existing indexes.

## Example of Index Usage

Let's consider an example where you have a database table called "Employees" with the following columns: "EmployeeID", "FirstName", "LastName", and "Department".

Suppose you frequently query the table to retrieve all employees belonging to a specific department. To improve the performance of this query, you can create an index on the "Department" column. Here's an example of how the index would be used:

1. Without an index:
    
    sqlCopy code
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';
    ```
    
    In this case, without an index, the database engine would need to perform a full scan of the "Employees" table. It would examine every row, checking the "Department" column for a match with the condition 'Sales'.
    
2. With an index:
    
    sqlCopy code
    
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_Department ON Employees (Department);
    ```
    
    By creating an index on the "Department" column, you provide the database engine with a faster way to locate the relevant rows. Now, when you execute the same query, the database engine can use the index to perform an index lookup:
    
    sqlCopy code
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';
    ```
    
    The database engine would navigate through the index's data structure, find the rows that match the condition 'Sales', and retrieve them directly from the table based on the pointers stored in the index. This process is faster than scanning the entire table.
    

By using an index on the "Department" column, you can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter based on the department. Indexes help the database engine locate the relevant rows efficiently, reducing the need for full table scans and improving query response times.
