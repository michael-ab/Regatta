### Driver Project Meeting
- Interface branch 
	- For example: client -> regatta_api
- Build JDBC is apart of the rdb project. Need to build it alone in the driver directory
- Driver is EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL, isn't buid when building rdb project.
- In the driver makefile if we change only c++ files we build only them. Same for Java.
- Need to format with clang-format.
- For Java we are working with Sun from Oracle.
- Doxygene for c++ (run with ./run_doxygen.sh).
- CheckStyle: For Java only (to replace doxygene).
- Logging: We are using SLF4J and logback
- We are using only DEBUG - INFO - ERROR
- We have 100 MB of log (overwrite if full) in reg_jdbc_logs directory.
