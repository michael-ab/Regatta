### Driver Project Meeting
- Interface branch 
	- For example: client -> regatta_api
- Build JDBC is apart of the rdb project. Need to build it alone in the driver directory
- Driver is EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL, isn't buid when building rdb project.
- In the driver makefile if we change only c++ files we build only them. Same for Java.
- Need to format with clang-format.
- For Java we are working with Sun from Oracle.
