In 1 batch we can have updates (don't return resultSet) or selects (return resultSet)

{
NumStatements = 3,
IsRS = true, (ResultSet=Select, etc.)
num_cols = 3,
num_rows =4,
values = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12},
RC = kNetworkTimeOut, kSuccess, etc.
} ->

| A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 3   |
| 4   | 5   | 6   |
| 7   | 8   | 9   |
| 10  | 11  | 12 |


Return for updates [10, 20, 30] (number of affected rows)

Need to return also errors


rdb/src/drivers/jdbc : reg_jni.cc, jdbc.cc

rdb/src/drivers/jdbc/src/main/java/dev/regatta/jdbc

all java fails except main and exceptions
