### what is a predicate in the SQL world?
In the SQL (Structured Query Language) world, a predicate refers to a logical condition or expression that determines whether a particular row of data satisfies a certain criterion. Predicates are an integral part of SQL queries and are used to filter and select specific data from database tables.

Predicates are typically used in the WHERE clause of SQL statements to specify conditions that the data must meet to be included in the result set. The WHERE clause allows you to apply one or more predicates to filter the rows returned by a query.
