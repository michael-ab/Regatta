Next two weeks: → Operator Algorithms → Query Processing Models → Runtime Architectures 3 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) Q U E R Y P L A N The operators are arranged in a tree. Data flows from the leaves of the tree up towards the root. The output of the root node is the result of the query. 4 SELECT A.id, B.value FROM A, B WHERE A.id = B.id AND B.value > 100 A B A.id=B.id value>100 A.id, B.value ⨝ s p CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) D I S K- O R I E N T E D D B M S Just like it cannot assume that a table fits entirely in memory, a disk-oriented DBMS cannot assume that the results of a query fits in memory. We are going use on the buffer pool to implement algorithms that need to spill to disk. We are also going to prefer algorithms that maximize the amount of sequential access. 5 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) T O D AY ' S A G E N D A External Merge Sort Aggregations 6 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) W H Y D O W E N E E D T O S O R T ? Tuples in a table have no specific order. But queries often want to retrieve tuples in a specific order. → Trivial to support duplicate elimination (DISTINCT). → Bulk loading sorted tuples into a B+Tree index is faster. → Aggregations (GROUP BY). 7 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) S O R T I N G A L G O R I T H M S If data fits in memory, then we can use a standard sorting algorithm like quick-sort.
