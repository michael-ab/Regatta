Cost-based Search → Use a model to estimate the cost of executing a plan. → Evaluate multiple equivalent plans for a query and pick the one with the lowest cost. 3 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) T O D AY ' S A G E N D A Plan Cost Estimation Plan Enumeration Nested Sub-queries 4 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) C O S T E S T I M AT I O N How long will a query take? → CPU: Small cost; tough to estimate → Disk: # of block transfers → Memory: Amount of DRAM used → Network: # of messages How many tuples will be read/written? It is too expensive to run every possible plan to determine this information, so the DBMS need a way to derive this information… 5 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) S TAT I S T I C S The DBMS stores internal statistics about tables, attributes, and indexes in its internal catalog.
