Approach #2: Heterogenous Nodes → Nodes are assigned specific tasks. → Can allow a single physical node to host multiple \"virtual\" node types for dedicated tasks. 17 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) M O N G O D B H E T E R O G E N O U S A R C H I T E C T U R E 18 Router (mongos) Shards (mongod) P3 P4 P1 P2 P1→ID:1-100 P2→ID:101-200 P3→ID:201-300 P4→ID:301-400 Config Server (mongod) Router (mongos) ⋮ ⋮ Application Server Get Id=101 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) D ATA T R A N S PA R E N C Y Users should not be required to know where data is physically located, how tables are partitioned or replicated.

D I S T R I B U T E D A single-node txn only accesses data that is contained on one partition. → The DBMS does not need coordinate the behavior concurrent txns running on other nodes. A distributed txn accesses data at one or more partitions. → Requires expensive coordination. 29 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) T R A N S A C T I O N C O O R D I N AT I O N If our DBMS supports multi-operation and distributed txns, we need a way to coordinate their execution in the system. Two different approaches: → Centralized: Global \"traffic cop\". → Decentralized: Nodes organize themselves. 30 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) T P M O N I T O R S Example of a centralized coordinator. Originally developed in the 1970-80s to provide txns between terminals and mainframe databases. → Examples: ATMs, Airline Reservations. Many DBMSs now support the same functionality internally. 31 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) Coordinator C E N T R A L I Z E D C O O R D I N AT O R 32 PartitionsLock Request Acknowledgement Commit Request Safe to commit?Application Server P3 P4 P1 P2 P1 P2 P3 P4 CMU 15-445/645 (Fall 2019) C E N T R A L I Z E D C O O R D I N AT O R 33Middleware Query Requests Safe to commit?
